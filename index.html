          I am just a dude from Bangalore who wants to do something special with
          his life, maybe make the world a better place. I like solving problems
          and that's why I chose Computer Science for my Bachelor of Technology
          degree. Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are the most
          interesting to me, because, like, how can a computer even do this
          stuff?

          I actually like studying, not the way school teaches, but when you
          actually study to learn something you love. I love playing sports,
          mainly basketball. Some of my hobbies are investing in stocks, playing
          video games, and drawing.

          My ideal life would be one where I could travel the world non-stop,
          staying a month or 2 in each place, while coding and investing on the
          go. As long as I like the problems I keep trying to solve, I'll do any
          job. I don't want to waste more time doing higher education because
          it's a scam, honestly, especially in this day and age with the
          internet. I would love to build something as amazing as the internet.
          I hope opportunity comes calling.
